# ibisPaint Artwork Animation Generator

This is a tool that creates an .ipv animation file with a custom resolution, which can be loaded and edited in ibisPaint and ibisPaint X without the use of the prime membership

## How to use generated .ipv?

On Android, in your file browser: Select file, then share with the ibisPaint(X) app
On iOS, idk you figure it out (hopefully)?
